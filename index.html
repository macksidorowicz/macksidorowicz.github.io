                         <p>
                            I've always been inspired by digital simulations; the ability to recreate real-world systems 
                            within a virtual environment forever amazes me, so having learnt Python as part of my school 
                            curriculum, I had quickly leaned towards Pygame, where I have experimented with numerous different 
                            (though incomplete) games. This also led me to look into coding in C++, and even in Roblox Studio's Luau, 
                            so that I can further expand my existing knowledge of game development. Recently, I have also 
                            started to learn web development; this portfolio is my first project in HTML, CSS, and JS.
                            <br>I plan to study at a Russell Group university, such as Cambridge, and later become a game or simulation developer. 
                            In the meantime I hope to enhance my web development skills.

                                    <li><span>GCSE</span><br>I have heavily enjoyed studying CS during GCSE, and I have
                                        always put in as much effort as possible when tackling programmed-based problems.</li>
                                    <li><span>A-Level</span><br>I am currently studying A-Level CS. I especially look forward
                                    to studying neural and computer networks - how systems can calculate and categorise data,
                                as well as communicate with each other.</li>
                                    <li><span>EPQ</span><br>For my EPQ I am coding an A.I. image classifier. Currently I am researching different
                                    methods of achieving this; experimenting with Tensorflow (Keras) or PyTorch, both Python libraries. 
                                    I hope to one day be able to apply the model to classify and categorise human faces, as well as military vehicles; 
                                    in this way I can explore existing issues and contraversies with the use of A.I. within surveillance and military applications.</li>

                                    <li><span>Python/C++</span><br>Having mainly used Python for my GCSE course, I feel quite
                                    comfortable using it to develop programed solutions and even games (with Pygame, eg). I had also begun to learn
                                how to code in C++ out of interest, albeit I am far less developed in it.</li>
                                    <li><span>Game development</span><br>As mentioned, I love making small (and unfinished) games, especially in
                                    a familiar and forgiving environment such as Pygame. As such, I also played around with Roblox Studio's Luau to explore 
                                the less familiar environment.</li>
                                    <li><span>Web development</span><br>Learning a new language is always fun for me. Developing this portfolio has
                                    given me the perfect introduction into HTML, CSS, and JS, and has already caused countless website and application
                                    ideas running in my head.</li>

                                    points in a competitive environment, all against the clock. I not only bring my prior Python knowledge in order
                                to maximise our performance, but I also wish to develop our own team website to show off our progress to other teams,
                            and competition judges, of course. </li>

                            without any built-in or imported function. I found it to be a fun exercise using maths and list indexing.
